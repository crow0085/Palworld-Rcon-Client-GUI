# Palworld Rcon GUI

A simple palworld rcon gui for those who dont want to use an rcon cli. Design is still a work in progress, but for now it does what you need it to do





## Features

- Broadcast
- Save
- Shutdown
- Kick Player
- Ban Player (If command doesnt work, make sure to have banlist.txt in Pal\Saved\SaveGames)
- Show list of players


## TODO

add styling to better identify which nav is currently selected


## Install
Download or clone the repository, and open the project in your favorite editor 
(I will add a release later)

Run the command to install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install  
```

run the command to start the app:

  npm start  
```
